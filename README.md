# bookdown-reports

This is a proof of concept for generating reports based on Bookdown with data provided from DINA-Web APIs and an example of publishing result at GitHub Pages.

## What is bookdown?

You can make (and even print with good quality) books and reports based on markdown! Using bookdown (R). Details at https://bookdown.org/.

## Rationale

This model of working allows for similar support to what http://arpha.pensoft.net/ markets on their webpage, ie collaborative authoring, reviewing and publishing. It enables writing of  research with solid support for online revisions (through git), provides decentralized collaborative work with co-authors and peers and also exports in formats such as .pdf and .epub with simple authoring using markdown but while allowing for professional print quality.

## Free hosting of bookdown reports at GitHub Pages

Here is this bookdown report, ie a simple example with some QR codes pointing embedding a URL
with a "persistent identifier", published at GitHub Pages:

## HOWTO host/publish bookdown .html reports at GitHub

Specific step-by-step instructions for publishing .html format bookdown results at GitHub:

You can get the reports in .pdf or .epub formats (attached) if you prefer that over .html...
