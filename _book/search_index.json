Combining dinar with other R-packages such as rmarkdown, knitr, bookdown provides functionaly to provide reports based on DINA-Web data. Output includes both reproducible static canned reports as well as live reports that embed interative content and cover formats such as HTML, PDF and EPUB. 1.1 Compiling books with bookdown This content is a bookdown report that compiles several markdown files together and specifically demonstrate fetching data with dinar and authoring a markdown report with QR codes. 1.2 Writing journal articles etc Instead of bookdown the same approach as demonstrated here - ie fetching data with dinar and authoring reports - can utilize rticles - a package which allows producing articles in formats that adhere to various guidelines required from various journals (JSS, CTeX, R Journal, ACM articles, ACS articles, Elsevier etc)… 1.3 More details An excellent webinar is available to provide a quick-start tutorial for the bookdown package and content authoring using markdown: Webinar about Bookdown "],

["qr-codes-for-collection-objects.html", "3 QR codes for Collection Objects 3.1 Automated parameterized reports 3.2 Embedding dinar calls within ODF documents", " 3 QR codes for Collection Objects A QR code can lead to any URL. For sets of Collection Objects with known identifiers - provided from dinar, etiquettes and labels with QR codes could be generated in this fashion in various formats Below we use a public on-line example with a URL embedding an identifier for a bird. library(qrcode) identifier &lt;- &quot;3c42a44c-096a-445d-b574-22297e96373d&quot; tgt &lt;- paste0(&quot;https://birds.dina-web.net/species/&quot;, identifier, &quot;.html&quot;) The QR codes below lead to “https://birds.dina-web.net/species/3c42a44c-096a-445d-b574-22297e96373d.html”. A smaller variant: The same thing slightly larger: 3.1 Automated parameterized reports Reports written in markdown format can be parameterized and then generated automatically. # assumes a markdown report template exists with name &quot;docx-report.Rmd&quot; # generates output in Word format with a specific value provided for # the paramterized reports parameter(s) rmarkdown::render(&quot;docx-report.Rmd&quot;, output_file = &quot;example-01.docx&quot;, params = list(target = &quot;birds.dina-web.net/species/&quot;)) # inspect results using the default app for .docx files system2(&quot;xdg-open&quot;, &quot;~/example-01.docx&quot;) 3.2 Embedding dinar calls within ODF documents Existing Open Document files can be used as report templates by embedding dinar calls using a special syntax. Here is an example of how a report template in ODT format can be “woven” into a report, embedding dinar calls to fetch data from DINA-Web: library(odfWeave) # render the report odfWeave(file = &quot;~/example.odt&quot;, dest = &quot;~/example02.odt&quot;) # display it system2(&quot;xdg-open&quot;, &quot;~/example01.odt&quot;) Although this is possible, it seems to be for the brave and a better approach is probably to use markdown in the report templates.
